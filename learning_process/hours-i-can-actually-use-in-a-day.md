# 24 hours in a day. How many hours I can actually use?

> Sat, 20 May 2017 at 6:50:50 MYT

This writing is based on my observation upon my self. So far, I need to sleep 6 hours a day to make an effective day. Hence, it's a 6 hours less. On top of that, I'll do shower twice which takes me roughly 30 minutes for each day. That's it 30 mins less.

Now I have my remaining 17.5 hours (24 hours - 6 hours - 30 mins). I pray 5 times a day. For every prayer, it takes about 10 minutes, which makes 50 minutes a day. I'll round it to 60 mins to make the calculation easier, which left me another *16.5 hours left*.

I usually eat 3 times a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. If for thus 3 times takes me 30 mins each, that is another 1.5 hours less. Now I have *15 hours left*.

That 15 hours every day is the time that I can effectively use for work, study, play, etc. If I've to work 8 hours a day, means that I'll have only *7 hours for other things* (study, play, etc).

While this might not interest you, my observation has made me aware that I don't actually have 24 hours day. In my case, assuming that I've to work 8 hours day will leave me ***7 hours a day***. There is high chance that I will fail to do whatever I wanted to do in each day, unless if I plan it well. One good quote that often struck in my mind,

Plan the day well, and achieve more. Cheers!
