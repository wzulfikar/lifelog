# How to Manage Word Barriers

One of the things I find it good to know about *interpersonal communication*. Got it from [this book by Pearson](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781292040318).

| Problem | Example | What to Do |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Bypassing, which causes missed meaning:** Confusioncaused by the fact that the same word may evoke different meanings for different people | W.C. might mean “wayside chapel” to a Swiss person and “water closet” to a British person (Americans know this as “the bathroom”) |• ***When speaking:*** provide specific examples. • ***When listening:*** *ask questions to clarify* the meaning |
| **Lack of clarity:** Inappropriate or *imprecise use* of words | Sign in Acapulco Hotel: “The manager has personally passed all the water served here.” | • ***When speaking:*** use precise language whenever possible; provide short, specific examples or indicate the probability of something happening: “There's a 40 percent change I won't go shopping today.” • ***When listening:*** paraphrase the message to ensure you understand it correctly |
| **Not being specific and using *Allness* language:** Tendency to *lump* things or people into *all-encompassing* category | “*All Texans* drive pick-up trucks and hang rifles in their back windows. ” | • ***When speaking:*** say ***to me*** before you offer a generalization, to indicate that the idea or perception is your own. Index a generalized statement by using phrases that separate one situation, person, or example from another • ***When listening:*** ask the speaker whether he or she means to say that *all* situations or every person fits the generalization presented.|
| **Static evaluation and not being aware of change:** *Labeling* people, objects, or events without considering how things evolve | You still call your twenty-eight-year-old nephew a “juvenile delinquent” because he spray-painted your fence when he was eleven | ***• When speaking:*** place your observation in a time frame: “I thought he was a difficult child when he was in elementary school.” ***• When listening:*** Ask the speaker whether the observation remains true today or if the same generalization applies now. |
| **Either/Or Polarization:** Use of either/or terms (good or bad, right or wrong)| “You're either for me or against me” | ***• When speaking:*** avoid either/or terms and blaming something on a specific cause. ***• When listening:*** ask the speaker whether a statement really reflects an all-or-nothing either/or proposition.|
| **Biased language:** Use of language that reflects gender, racial, ethnic, age, ability, or class bias| “His mom is a *mailman*” | ***• When speaking:*** be mindful of how insensitive language can hurt someone. Avoid using labels or derogatory terms. ***• When listening:*** try to keep your emotions in check when others use inappropriate words or derogatory phrases. You can't control what others do or say, only what *you* do and say and how *you* react. Consider appropriately but assertively communicating that a word, label, or phrase offends you.|
