# How to Manage Word Barriers

One of the things I find it good to know about *interpersonal communication*. Got it from [this book by Pearson](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781292040318).

| Problem | Example | What to Do |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Bypassing, which causes missed meaning:** Confusioncaused by the fact that the same word may evoke different meanings for different people | 1:2 | 2:2 |
| **Lack of clarity:** Inappropriate or *imprecise use* of words | 1:3 | 2:3 |
| **Not being specific and using *Allness* language:** Tendency to *lump* things or people into *all-encompassing* category | 1:4 | 2:4 |
| **Static evaluation and not being aware of change:** Labeling people, objects, or events without considering how things evolve | 1:5 | 2:5 |
| **Either/Or Polarization:** User of either/or terms (good or bad, right or wrong)| 1:6 | 2:6 |
| **Biased language:** Use of language that reflects gender, racial, ethnic, age, ability, or class bias| “His mom is a *mailman*” | 2:6 |
