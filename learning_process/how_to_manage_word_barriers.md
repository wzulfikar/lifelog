# How to Manage Word Barriers

One of the things I find it good to know about *interpersonal communication*. Got it from [this book by Pearson](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781292040318).

| Problem | Example | What to Do |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Bypassing, which causes missed meaning:** Confusioncaused by the fact that the same word may evoke different meanings for different people | W.C. might mean “wayside chapel” to a Swiss person and “water closet” to a British person (Americans know this as “the bathroom”) |• ***When speaking:*** provide specific examples. • ***When listening:*** *ask questions to clarify* the meaning |
| **Lack of clarity:** Inappropriate or *imprecise use* of words | Sign in Acapulco Hotel: “The manager has personally passed all the water served here.” | • ***When speaking:*** use precise language whenever possible; provide short, specific examples or indicate the probability of something happening: “There's a 40 percent change I won't go shopping today.” • ***When listening:*** paraphrase the message to ensure you understand it correctl |
| **Not being specific and using *Allness* language:** Tendency to *lump* things or people into *all-encompassing* category | 1:4 | 2:4 |
| **Static evaluation and not being aware of change:** Labeling people, objects, or events without considering how things evolve | You still call your twenty-eight-year-old nephew a “juvenile delinquent” because he spray-painted your fence when he was eleven | 2:5 |
| **Either/Or Polarization:** User of either/or terms (good or bad, right or wrong)| “You're either for me or against me” | 2:6 |
| **Biased language:** Use of language that reflects gender, racial, ethnic, age, ability, or class bias| “His mom is a *mailman*” | 2:6 |
