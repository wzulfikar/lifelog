# Learning Process

Things I learned. Maybe from books I read, person, lecturer, random web surfing, etc.


By the way, I just stumbled upon this “learnt vs learned” article 😁 :

To someone who you think is arrogant, don't say "You're arrogant". Instead, say "If you do this, people will tend to see you as an arrogant.". To me as for now, the latter can deliver the point better, for both.
