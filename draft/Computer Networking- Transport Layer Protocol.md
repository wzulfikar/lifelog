# Computer Networking: Transport Layer Protocol
> Thu, 30 Mar 2017 at 08:35:24 MYT

- role of transport layer: establish session
- transport layer has many protocol in order to establish the link
- TCP/IP uses 2 protocols:
  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  - User Diagram Protocol (UDP)
- RFC: Request for Comment
- in networking, each layer will work with its neighbouring layers
- OSI has another layer called session layer
- TCP will make sure the data arrive (unlike UDP)
- TCP == less overhead
  - overhead: extra info other than the actual data
- TCP == transport layer, SMTP == application layer
- UDP: best effort to reach destination (if not reach, then live with it :v)
- TCP uses 3-way handshake
