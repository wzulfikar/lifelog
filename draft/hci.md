- What makes an effective human-computer interface?  
Well designed, effective computer systems generate positive feelings of success, competence, mastery, and clarity in the user community. When an interactive system is well-designed, the interface *almost disappears*, enabling users to concentrate on their work, exploration, or pleasure.

- Humans are highly attuned to images and visual information [tufte83][kosslyn89][larkin87].
- Visualization of inherently abstract information is more difficult, and visualization of textually represented information is especially challenging. 
-  Language is our main means of communicating abstract ideas for which there is no obvious physical manifestation. eg: What does a picture look like that describes negotiations over a trade agreement in which one party demands concessions on environmental policies while the other requires help in strengthening its currency?
- some visualisation techniques: brushing, linking, panning, zooming, focus-plus-context, magic lenses, animation
- When an interactive system is well-designed, the interface almost disappears, enabling users to concentrate on their work, exploration, or pleasure.

- Animations are a crucial element of interaction design, but they should always serve a purpose. They should never be done for animation’s sake.
