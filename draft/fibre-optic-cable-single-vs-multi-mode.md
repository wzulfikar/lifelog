## Single Mode
- Has a small diametral core that *allows only one mode of light* to propagate.
- Since it allows only one mode of light to progagate, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core decreases which in turn, lowers attenuation and creates the ability for the signal to travel further.
- Typically used in long distance, higher bandwidth runs by Telcos, CATV companies, and Colleges and Universities.
- Usually 9/125 in construction, which means that the core to cladding diameter ratio is 9 to 125 microns.

## Multimode
- Has a large diametral core that allows multiple modes of light to propagate.
- Due to its large core, some of the light rays that make up the digital pulse may travel a direct route, and some others travel in zigzag as they bounce off the cladding. These alternate paths cause the different groups of light rays, referred to as modes, to arrive separately at the receiving point.
- Since it allows multiple modes of light to propagate, the number of light reflections increases and allows more data to pass through at a given time.
- Because of the high dispersion and attenuation rate with this type of fiber, the *quality of the signal is reduced over long distances.*
- Typically used for short distance, data and audio/video applications in LANs.
-  RF broadband signals, such as what cable companies commonly use, cannot be transmitted over multimode fiber.
- Usually has core of 50/62.5 microns
