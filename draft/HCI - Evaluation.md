- when to evaluate? 
    - formative evaluation: stage by stage
    - summative evaluation: when product is finished
- methods of evaluation (McGrath)
    - naturalistic: descriptive-driven, observation occurs in realistic setting
    - experimental: number-driver
- trade-off:
    - naturalistic: faster, more realistic
    - experimental: slower, precision
- triangulation: combination of result
- evaluation paradigm, according to Preece et.al.:
    - usability testing
    - field study
    - predictive evaluation: use experts
    - quick & dirty
