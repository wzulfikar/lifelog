- ISO 9241 "The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use"
- usability relates to result, process, techniques & philosophy of designing to meet user needs

## Effect
1. abandoned application

## Example

â†’ Browser (Opera) 

1. when new tab opened, the cursor will be automatically moved into the search bar 
- the search bar, even though it's blank, it has the placeholder that informs the user what to do without interrupting their flow
- below the search bar, the browser has put commonly visited sites for the user
- icon of reload button looks like common reload button so the user can predict that it's function is to reload the page
- hovering any button will display description about the function of that particular button
