# Interpersonal Communication

> Communication is to a relationship what breathing is to maintaining life  – [Virginia Satir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Satir)

“Human communication is at the core of our existence.”

Some interesting questions:
- Why do we like some people and not the others?
- How can we interpret other people's unspoken messages with greater accuracy?
- Why do some relationship blossoms and others deteriorate?
- How can we better manage disagreements with others?
- How can we better understand our relationship with our family, friends and coworkers?

>**other-oriented** : To be aware of the thoughts, needs, experiences, personality, emotions, motives, desires, culture, and goals of your communication partners ***while still*** maintaining your own integrity.

Be **other-oriented**, not **self-oriented**.

Communication: process of acting on information.
