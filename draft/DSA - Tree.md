- worst in binary tree: `O(N)`
- what we want: `Log N`
- to reach `Log N`, we use Balance Binary Tree
- AVL tree: BST in which every node in the tree, the height of left and right subtrees differ by at most 1
- restore AVL balance by doing rotation
- rotation type: single & double

> An Adelson-Velskii Landis (AVL) tree is a self-balancing BST that maintains it's height to be O(log N) when having N vertices in the AVL tree. â€“ visualgo.net
