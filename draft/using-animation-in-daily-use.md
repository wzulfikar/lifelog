Rachel Nabors, an invited web animations expert at the W3C, suggests five principles to keep in mind when designing animations3:

Animate deliberately: think through each animation before you create it.
It takes more than 12 principles: Disneyâ€™s 12 principles of animation work for films, but not necessarily for websites and apps.
Useful and necessary, then beautiful: aesthetics should take the back seat to UX.
Go four times faster: good animations are unobtrusive, which means they run fast.
Install a kill switch: for large animations such as parallex effects, create an opt-out button.
