# Handy hasing with `jshashes`

- to use it globally, execute `npm i -g jshashes`
- example: create `sha1-b64` hash â†’ `hashes sha1-b64 'hi!'` which will print `Oph6z4y8ECi328hr0IaDEVGJmis=`
- you may want to create alias for the command to make it shorter: `alias hash=hashes` so you can execute `hash sha1-b64 'hi!'` which to me, easier to remember (personal preference)
