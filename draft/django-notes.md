Quoted from Django
- Django apps are “pluggable”: You can use an app in multiple projects, and you can distribute apps, because they don’t have to be tied to a given Django installation. – https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial02/
- Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that _doesn’t require much creativity_. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models. - Django Philosophy.
- Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between “content publishers” and the “public” site. - Django Philosophy.

# self note
- migration in django: create model -> create migration file -> migrate
- `python manage.py shell` is equivalent to `artisan tinker` (console with app context)
