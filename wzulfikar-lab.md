Welcome to the lab! 

It's not the actual lab, of course. It's just a github repository which contains codes, grouped by their language or functions. 

While the codes are written for experiment, test, or even just for fun, it still might be of your interest. Maybe, something like, a script to do [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (Optical Character Recognition) combined with OSX automator so you can *right-click* an image and extract the text from it. Well, who knows.

Anyway, since you've read this far, you may want to check the repo. Here you go ðŸ˜Š
