Welcome to the lab! 

Just kidding, it's not an actual lab. It's just a github repository containing codes, grouped by programming language or functionality. 

While the codes are written for experiment, basic tooling, personal preferences, test, or even just for fun, it still might be of your interest. 

Maybe, something like, a script to do [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (Optical Character Recognition) combined with OSX automator so you can *right-click* an image and extract the text from it. Well, who knows.

Anyway, since you've read this far, you may want to check the repo. Here you go ðŸ˜Š
