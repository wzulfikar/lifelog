# How I set this thing up

I use OSX, 10.9.5 and have both Github Desktop and GitBook Editor installed.

Honestly, I couldn't easily wrap my mind on how this GitBook work. A bit frustrated, but finally managed to make this up and running.

>To do this, you must have signed up with GitBook and Github.
