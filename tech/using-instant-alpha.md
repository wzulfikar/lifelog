TL;DR â€“ Removing background from image, instantly.

If you're a designer, you may deal a lot with removing background from an image.  I've been using photoshop to do just that.

Thus, I was trying to look for alternative. I wanted something simpler. Aaaaand, turns out that OSX's Preview has above feature built-in since el-capitan.
