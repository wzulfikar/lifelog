# Decision-Support Systems (DSS)

*From Pearson, Management Information System: Managing The Digital Firm*

DDS focus on problems that are *unique and rapidly changing*, for which the procedure for arriving at a solution may not be fully predefined in advance.

DDS try to answer questions such as these:
- What would be the impact on production schedules if we were to double sales in the month of December?
- What would happen to our return on investment if a factory schedule were delayed for six months?

>Although DDS use internal information from TPS & MIS, they often bring in information from external sources such as current stock prices or product prices of competitors.

Example of small but interesting & powerful DDS: voyage estimating system.
