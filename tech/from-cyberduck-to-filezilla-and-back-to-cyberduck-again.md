# From Cyberduck to Filezilla, and back to Cyberduck again.

I was using cyberduck before (https://cyberduck.io), but not really using it. I was using it _only_ for ftp, which i consider as _not really using_ it.

since i was using it only for ftp, i switched back to filezilla â€“ more friendly to me back then, although its ui was bit cluttered compared to cyberduck.

recently, i tried to use cyberduck again. turns out that i've missed a lot. the ui is more simple, easy to understand. it provides numerous useful connection besides standard FTP and SFTP such as Google Drive, Amazon S3, Windows Azure Storage, Rackspace, etc. the Google Drive connection helps me a lot to manage multiple Drive accounts. connecting to SFTP just become easier, and neat.

> one more: now you can install cyberduck in Windows!

eventho cyberduck identified itself as free software, it encourages the user to donate for the development. well, for me, it worths the donation. it provides a lot of _useful_ function, and donation is just one way for us to appreciate developers' hard works.
