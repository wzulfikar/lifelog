# From Wordpress to GitBook

I was using Wordpress to write. Last about 2 months. 

It is good platform, easy to use but I just don't feel comfortable with it. 

- It requires me to have internet connection to write
- Thus things I wrote aren't stored somewhere I can touch

For the first issue, actually I can write somewhere, copy it, and paste it to Wordpress when I get online.

The second issue, I can host my own Wordpress site. However, Wordpress store thus posts (and almost anything else) in database which I don't feel good with it. I want to store thus things in say, markdown file.

Next, I moved to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com). Out of the box, it has some cool features. Scheduled post, markdown support, private post, custom domain, etc. But I still get the problem I had with Wordpress: internet connection. However, [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) has mobile apps which is nice.

When using [tumblr](http://tumblr.com), I write things in markdown and push to my GitHub repository. Then, I'll copy thus markdown to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com). 

Started to feel the pain with my [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) setup, I tried to find other alternatives. 

I used [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) before, to write documentation of a project I was working on. I wasn't really interested with it, but after digging more to its documentation and features, I feel really comfortable with it.

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) has thus things I always wanted.

- Keep writing, regardless of internet connection
- Keep your writings around you
- Desktop App
- Version Control
