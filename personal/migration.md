# “Migration”

I was using Wordpress to write. Last about 2 months. 

It is good platform, easy to use but I just don't feel comfortable with it. 

- It requires me to have internet connection to write
- Thus things I wrote aren't stored somewhere I can touch

For the first issue, actually I can write somewhere, copy it, and paste it to Wordpress when I get online.

The second issue, I can host my own Wordpress site. However, Wordpress store thus posts (and almost anything else) in database which I don't feel good with it. I want to store thus things in say, markdown file.

Next, I moved to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com). Out of the box, it has some cool features. Scheduled post, private post, custom domain, etc. But I still get the problem I had with Wordpress: internet connection. However, [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) has mobile apps which is nice.
