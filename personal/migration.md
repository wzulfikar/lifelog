# “Migration”

I was using Wordpress to write. Last about 2 months. 

It is good platform, easy to use but I just don't feel comfortable with it. It requires me to have internet connection to write. Well, actually I can write somewhere, copy it, and paste it to Wordpress when I get online.

Next, I moved to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com). Out of the box, it has some cool features. Scheduled post, private post, custom domain, etc. But I still get the problem I had with Wordpress: internet connection.
