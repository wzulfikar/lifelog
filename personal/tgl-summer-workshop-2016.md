> TGL stands for **The Great Lab**. 

***1. Why did you decide to join TGL Summer Workshop?***

To see if I can get more friends, associates & learn something new. And to see if I can get opportunity to visit any industry in Penang (and yes, I got it).

***2. What's your opinion of the company visits? Where did you go and what did you do?***

I go to ViTrox for company visit. I'm grateful that I visit ViTrox. Now I know about machine vision and how vital is its role in IT industry.

***3. What's your opinion of the technical workshop? Did you enjoyed it, and why?***

The technical workshop, the arduino is very interesting. It managed to *seduce* me to learn more about it. 

The CATiA session has so much awesomeness. It helps develop the betterment of community, a lot. Using CATiA to simulate behaviour of real objects surely has made life of engineers easier.

***4.What's your opinion of the talk session? Which of the talk that you like and why?***

The talk sessions are, awesome. I got knowledge about what is CREST, UST Global, etc which indeed, opened my mind about industry related stuffs. 

I didn't know about CREST before. But now, yeah, CREST does a lot of interesting stuffs. 

The talk about agile & scrum, that's cool. When doing sprint myself, I and my team often have problem with one of the scrum key, *transparency*. The speaker told us some tricks to overcome this problem, as what his team did in Intel.

***5. What have you gained from this experience?***

I gained a lot, social & technical wise. The diverse participants attract me to challenge my communication skill, while the technical workshops keep me updated with current industry situation.

***6. Do you like Penang and why do you like it?***

This is my first time visiting Penang, and by far, I like Penang in a way that it has so many industry. For students like me, with the help of CREST, it can be the center of self-development process and a must-visit place.
