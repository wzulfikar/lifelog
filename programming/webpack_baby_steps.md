webpack will analyze your entry file for dependencies to other files. These files (called modules) are included in your bundle.js too. webpack will give each module a unique id and save all modules accessible by id in the bundle.js file. Only the entry module is executed on startup. A small runtime provides the require function and executes the dependencies when required.

webpack can only handle JavaScript natively, so we need the css-loader to process CSS files. We also need the style-loader to apply the styles in the CSS file.


We donâ€™t want to write such long requires require("!style!css!./style.css");.

We can bind file extensions to loaders so we just need to write: require("./style.css")
