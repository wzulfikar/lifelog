# Laravel 5.3
- built-in vue-js out of the box. check `assets/js/app.js`
- bootstrap is also built-in
- nice `variable.scss`
- nice example of vue component
- you have both `web` and `api` setup out of the box
- `routes` is no more in `Http/route.php`. It's now separated in their respective functionality; `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`
- webpack is now used in `gulpfile` by default
- better-formatted `gulp watch`
- `logout` functionality is using `POST` instead of `GET`
- `abort_unless`
- `laravel-echo`
- full-text search?
