##Centralized Workflow

##Feature Branch Workflow
When someone completes a feature, they donâ€™t immediately merge it into master. Instead, they push the feature branch to the central server and file a pull request asking to merge their additions into master.

Once a pull request is accepted, the actual act of publishing a feature is much the same as in the Centralized Workflow. First, you need to make sure your local master is synchronized with the upstream master. Then, you merge the feature branch into master and push the updated master back to the central repository.
