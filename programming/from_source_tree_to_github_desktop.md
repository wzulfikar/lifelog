# From Source Tree to GitHub Desktop

https://desktop.github.com

Outline:
- been using sourcetree for ~6 months.
- Was using GitHub Desktop, for like 1 week. It was very heavy on my machine so I uninstalled it. Tried to install it again, like, one week ago. Not sure why, but now it feel really light and fast, even compared to SourceTree.
- I was thinking that GitHub Desktop was created only for repository hosted in GitHub, Lol.
- While using SourceTree, I used to open many tabs for my multiple repository that I was working on. Using GitHub Desktop, I only need one tab, which is the app itself since all my repositories are listed in the sidebar.


GitHub Desktop:
- Has built-in tutorial
