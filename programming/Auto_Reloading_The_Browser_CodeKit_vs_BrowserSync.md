# Auto Reloading The Browser: CodeKit vs BrowserSync.

- I tried codekit, it's awesome tools. can handle a lot of projects including my laravel.
- BrowserSync has its own UI page to customize the setting like scroll-sync, etc. and if you're using Laravel, BrowserSync is ready out of the box. Awesome!
