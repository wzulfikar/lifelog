# Auto Reloading The Browser: CodeKit vs BrowserSync.

- I tried codekit, it's awesome tools. can handle a lot of projects including my laravel.
- BrowserSync has its own UI page to customize the setting like scroll-sync, etc. and if you're using Laravel, it supports for BrowserSync out of the box. Awesome!
- for my Laravel project, using codekit feels slower in my machine (MacbookAir 2011, Core i5, 4GB RAM) compared to using BrowserSync (via Laravel Elixir).
