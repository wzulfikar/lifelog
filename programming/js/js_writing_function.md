# JS: Writing Function

All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.



Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:
```javascript
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
```
