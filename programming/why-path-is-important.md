so, i've this friend that wants me to help her install stuffs to develop cordova hybrid mobile app.

issued this things in her cmd:

- `node -v` check if node is installed
- `npm -v` check if npm is installed
- `cordova` check if cordova is installed. if not, do `npm i -g cordova`
- `git -v` check if git is installed
- `android` check if android sdk is installed

she said she had "file can be moved" error when she install android sdk. since `android` is not recognized in her cmd, most likely because she didn't set up
