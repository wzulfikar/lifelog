# SublimeText in GIFs

List of things I used often in SublimeText.

* wrapping text selection in tag: `ctrl + shift + w`

  ![](/assets/gifs/wrapping-selection-in-tag-using-sublime.gif)

* paste without messing up the indents: `shift + cmd + v`

* indent (`cmd + [`) and unindent (`cmd + ]`)

* select a word (or words): `cmd + d`

* moving line up and down: `ctrl + cmd + arrow up or arrow down`

Paste While Respecting Indents: ⇧ + ⌘ + V
